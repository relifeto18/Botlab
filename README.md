# Botlab

Using a differential wheeled robot with a 2D lidar and 3-axis IMU to build a full SLAM system and plan path using A* on the map that can achieve autonomous navigation.

**Acting**: PID / differential-drive robot

**Sensing**: 2D LIDAR / MEMS IMU

**Reasoning**: Monte Carlo Localization / Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) / A* search
